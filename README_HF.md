# 🚀 AI Engineering Learning Roadmap

**Voice-Powered AI Learning with Real-Time Sentiment Analysis**

An interactive learning platform that analyzes your voice to understand your emotional state and provides personalized AI guidance for mastering AI engineering topics.

## 🎯 Features

- **🎤 Voice Recording & Sentiment Analysis** - Record your questions and get responses based on your emotional state
- **💬 AI-Powered Chatbot** - Interactive assistant for learning guidance using GPT-4
- **🗺️ Learning Path Explorer** - Navigate through 275+ hours of curated AI engineering content
- **📚 Topic-Specific Help** - Get targeted assistance for specific AI engineering topics
- **📈 Progress Tracking** - Track your learning journey through comprehensive topics
- **🎯 Personalized Recommendations** - AI adapts to your mood and learning style

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **🎤 Record** your learning question or express your confusion
2. **🗣️ Speech-to-text** converts your voice using OpenAI Whisper
3. **😊 Sentiment analysis** identifies your emotional state from voice patterns
4. **🤖 AI responds** with personalized help based on your mood and question
5. **💡 Smart recommendations** tailored to your emotional state and progress

## 🎭 Emotional Intelligence

The system detects six key emotional states:

- **😄 Excited** → Perfect for challenging topics like AI Agents
- **😊 Positive** → Great for structured learning like LLM APIs
- **😌 Calm** → Ideal for detailed topics like Security
- **😐 Neutral** → Good for methodical progress
- **😰 Stressed** → Suggests easier topics or breaks
- **😞 Negative** → Recommends motivational content

## 🔧 Technical Features

- **Audio Analysis**: Energy, tempo, spectral features, zero-crossing rate
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 and Whisper models
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant sentiment analysis and feedback
- **SOLID Architecture**: Clean, maintainable code following best practices
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test coverage

## 🛣️ Learning Content

**275+ hours of curated content across 11 topics:**

1. **LLM APIs** (20h) - Types, structured outputs, caching
2. **Model Adaptation** (30h) - Prompt engineering, fine-tuning
3. **Storage for Retrieval** (25h) - Vector databases, embeddings
4. **Orchestration** (25h) - Workflow management, agents
5. **AI Agents** (30h) - Multi-agent systems, tool use
6. **Evaluation** (20h) - Metrics, benchmarking
7. **Security** (25h) - AI safety, privacy
8. **Monitoring** (20h) - Observability, logging
9. **Deployment** (35h) - Production systems, scaling
10. **Infrastructure** (30h) - MLOps, cloud platforms
11. **Forward Elements** (15h) - Emerging trends, future tech

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Set up OpenAI API Key** (optional but recommended):
   - Get your key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
   - Add it to the Space's secrets as `OPENAI_API_KEY`

2. **Use the Voice Feature**:
   - Go to the "🎤 Voice + Sentiment Analysis" tab
   - Record your learning question naturally
   - Let your emotions show - the AI adapts to help you better!

3. **Explore Learning Paths**:
   - Check the "🗺️ Learning Path Explorer" for structured guidance
   - Use "📚 Topic Explorer" for deep dives into specific areas

## 🔑 Configuration

The app works with or without an OpenAI API key:

- **With API Key**: Full features including voice analysis and AI responses
- **Without API Key**: Basic roadmap exploration and progress tracking

## 🏗️ Architecture

Built with modern engineering practices:

- **Clean Architecture**: SOLID principles and dependency injection
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Modular Design**: Separate services for audio, AI, and UI
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and user-friendly messages
